# Proxy-Server

This is a Proxy Server written in Python as part of my Communication Network's class.

This project basically saves the website you just searched for (in this case www.google.com) as a proxy in the server's cache thus preventing the need, for when you conduct this website's search again, for it to retrieve the copy directly from it's hosting server, in turn, reducing the RTT for the search.

## Instructions for use
1) Open `cmd` into this directory
2) Type in: `ProxyServer.py [yourIP]`
3) Open Chrome (or your preffered browser) and type in: localhost:9876/www.google.com
